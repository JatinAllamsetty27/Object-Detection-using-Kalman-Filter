# Object-Detection-using-Kalman-Filter
The Kalman Filter is a recursive mathematical algorithm used for state estimation, specifically for filtering and smoothing noisy sensor measurements in a dynamic system. It provides an optimal estimate of the true state of a system based on a combination of predicted state and measurements.
